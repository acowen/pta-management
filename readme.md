# PTA-Management

PTA (parent teacher association) website designed to help keep track of members, students, teachers, and volunteers. The website will allow different schools to register and manage their own PTA. 

## Why?

The PTA that I am part of was still using notebooks and paper to keep track of members and finances. The goal of this project is to create an easy to use management system for the PTA. 

The first features of this project will focus on keeping track of members, students, teachers, and volunteers. Additional features will include keeping track of events and help with organization, finances, fund-raising, spirit-ware etc.

## Status

Just getting started! Will update readme.md soon.
